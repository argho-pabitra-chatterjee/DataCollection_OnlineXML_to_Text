# DataCollection_OnlineXML_to_Text
Massive amouunt of data sets can be collected from various public repositories in the form of XML. This code as a part of quick 
data collection activity for one of my Data Mining projets pulls articles from Medline Pubmed database which is in the form of XML files. 

Such datasets can be be used to build models and mine massive information to give new insights from the medical databases.
